password strength checker for passwords
this is my first repo ever created intentionaly..........It's nothing but a simple strength finder for password which 
works on basic of basic of javascript and css + a some Bytes of html borring code 

if password is having only alphabets then it is an easy password regardless of length of password
else if password contains numbers with alphabets then it is  moderate 
else if it contains numbers + alphabets + special symbols and length of password is greater than or equal to 8 then it considers 
the password as strong password
then if you make combination of all types and their combined length will be greater than or equal to 17 then it is super strong password 
which is very hard to break .
